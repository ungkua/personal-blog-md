## backstory
After SPM result’s day, the university and scholarship hunting started. There’s actually so much resources on the internet regarding scholarship offered to SPM leavers so much so that I don’t go through any of them because initially I’m not that comitted into getting a scholarship and I felt overwhelm with the number of scholarship offered.

I was just looking to get into local universities and only apply to one scholarship which is YTP-MARA since other scholarship requires you to write an essay about various topics and I’m to lazy to do that at the time.

For any of international’s reading this, we sent our local university application through a website like UCAS but you have 10 choices ordered by your preference and only one could send you an offer.

Luckily I got an offer from my one and only scholarship application. I am so excited since the scholarship provide me a chance to study abroad yet I’m still not sure about that path since there’s not much information about the specific scholarship or the whole process. This is one of the reasons I started writing about my experience so that others in the future could get a rough idea of what coming.

## kms life
I will write more about the scholarship details at the scholarship section. 

The day I got the offer, MARA only gave me 5 days to reply to the offer and register myself at Kolej MARA Seremban (KMS). The 5 days were hectic since it crosses the weekends and some places where I need to go close on the weekends. There are tons of documents you need to prepare and get them signed, you must be prepared for this as your whole life until you graduate will be full of preparing documents. The 5 days are over and I went to report myself at KMS.

I don’t have any expection arriving here as I have little to no exposure on KMS and A Level life but to be honest it’s just the same as MRSM, just a bit more freedom. Five years in MRSM have made me adapt to this kind of lifestyle so it’s not too hard for me.

Each of us are given a room of 3 with each get their own single bed, a standard locker, a table, a chair and a socket. There’s a policy where students could only bring 3 electrical appliances with them but they are not tightly enforced during my time there. Bring a stand fan and an electric mosquito repellent, as there’s only one fan and some room don’t have the insect netting at the windows. Food are served at Dewan Selera (DS) five times a day free of charge, food are okay with me. You could also buy at the cafe or food delivery if you fancy. Students also get RM100 allowances every month and a one off RM1500 during the first year to buy textbooks or any other things.

Everyday are filled with the same routine:

0700 - wake up and get ready

0800 - class start

1600 - class end

1700 - recreation

2000 - self study or relax

2300 - sleep

## a level
Students in KMS are ‘divided’ into 3 categories. Engineering, Social Sciences and Arts, all of that depends on your scholarship application earlier. The division you are in decides which undergradute course you could apply later and your A Level subject combination. I applied for engineering and my subject combination is Maths (compulsary for all), Physics (compulsary for engineering), Computer Science (this or chemistry) and Further Maths (optional 4th subject).

You could choose a minimum of 3 subjects and maximum of 4 subjects for your 2 years of A Level. Each year will have their own exam (AS and A2) which each contributing 50% of marks towards your final result. The combination of marks are what makes the A Level.

Each subject results uses the standard A,B,C grading but each grade carries a set amount of points (A-5, B-4, C-3 and so on) and your results are usually seen in the total results from your best 3 subjects which brings the maximum point to 15. According to MARA and my scholarship contract, one should achieve a minimum of 13 points in order for them to study overseas under MARA but it’s not the end of the world if you get less than that, you could either continue under MARA for local university or fund yourself to continue overseas study.

## subjects breakdown
Maths

Consisted of four modules each taken per semester. Pure Maths 1, Statistics 1, Pure Maths 3 and Mechanics but it depends on your division where engineering students will took Mechanics while the others will took Statistics 2 instead.

Pure Maths 1 and 3 are what I called normal maths. Statistics 1 go through the basic statistic and probabilities while Statistics 2 are more of hypothesis testing. Mechanics are part physics part maths where you do calculations based on real life situations.

Physics

Most topics are quite familiar if you have taken physics during your SPM but they go in depth with the concept. The exam have similar patterns and questions each year so past paper grinding is the solution to ace them.

Computer Science

First year syllabus teaches more about the basics of a computer system and are quite theory heavy. There is no actual programming in the first year, only psuedocodes and flow charts.

Second year are where the fun begins, you will learn to program your first code in one of the three language choice given by CIE (Python, Java or VB).
