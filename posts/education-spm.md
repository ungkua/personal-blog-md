## intro
This is where all of the story started, without my SPM results I could not further my studies overseas as I am now, it could be to expensive for my family to support.

All of my 5 years of secondary education were at MRSM Johor Bahru, which at that time were only the few MRSM’s that follows the dual certificate education system. One of it, SPM and the other one is IGCSE and if you pass both you should graduate with two secondary education certificate.

## igcse
I will explain IGCSE a bit for those who wants to know and for little bit of context for further topics, you could skip the following paragraphs if you don’t care. 

IGCSE certification were quite rare at that time (2015), only international schools and few MRSM’s offered them. The education syllabus were an adaptation of British’s GCSE. You will have two major examinations throughout your IGCSE which is a Checkpoint exam during Year 2 and IGCSE exam (O-Level) during Year 4. If you took both SPM and IGCSE, you have four major exams throughout your secondary level study, quite tiring if you ask me.

One could technically further their study to A Level or Foundation in Private universities if they have the means to, since A Level is a continuation to O Level that you took during Year 4 without taking SPM. But if you don’t take your SPM, people said that you lose your safety net as you must be sure you pass your A Level and into your degree since working in Malaysia required SPM as minimum level education.

To be honest, I do not took my IGCSE seriously since I only chose that particular MRSM since it is 15 minutes away from my home and I don’t see myself furthering my studies overseas at that time. Below are my IGCSE result for your viewing.

## spm
I could say that I’m not the brightess among my batch but I always scored sufficient grades to be placed at the top bracket, sadly this trends continues throughout my studies. I graduated First Class with a CGPA of 3.59 and placed 20th in my batch among 180ish students, not bad for me. My SPM results are 9A’s 1B (3A+, 4A, 2A-, 1B+)

I have done my best for it since my results for previous exams including my trial’s were bad, my Add Maths going from a D to an A were enough to make me proud. I shed tears when I first open my result, which show how happy I am and I also don’t put such a high expectation for the result day.

SPM days are my prime time, I have enough daily sleep, prayers on time, playing sports every evening, healthy foods and my focus during that time were laser-like. I could go on studying for hours if there’s nothing bothering me. Everyday I dreamt that times like that could come again.

If you asked me tips for acing your SPM I’m afraid that I could give none since things only work for yourself and I’m afraid ours don’t allign but if you asked me what I learnt from my SPM journey perhaps I could share some.

1. First of all, the outside of class things, the most important is to respect and build a good relationship with others regardless of who they are, Teachers, Staffs, Juniors and Fellow Batchmates. This may seem like a sily thing and have nothing to do with your academics but if your have a good relationship with others, your daily life will be easy since they could indirectly help you.
2. When close to exam times, don’t be afraid and shy to ask the teachers and your friends for guidance. The teachers will gladly answer them, I have never seen any teacher refused to answer the student questions. Shoutout to Miss Yan which taught my Add Maths during Year 5, she never felt boring answering my questions and I could say that she was a significant contribution to my Add Maths score. I’m still in contact with her even after finishing my SPM.
3. Minimise or prevent gadget usage. This may seem hard since everything is digital now but believe me that the source of my laser-like focus are the absence of technology in my daily life. When there’s no gadget you will be cut from the outside world and unrelated matters, a sacrifice one should make and a worth it one in my opinion. When only have your studies to think about, then you could focus on them more.

Thats all from my SPM time. Move on to the next chapter.
